description: Run the automated test suite (vitest) via Terminal.app delegation to bypass macOS TCC EPERM on node_modules
---

# Run Tests Workflow — FinOPS

This workflow uses `osascript` to delegate test execution to Terminal.app, which has Full Disk Access permissions. The agent terminal cannot run vitest directly due to macOS TCC blocking `lstat` on `node_modules`.

**Project path:** `/Users/tunckahveci/Desktop/FinOPS`

## Steps

// turbo-all

1. Clear any previous output file:
```bash
rm -f /tmp/vitest_output.txt
```

2. Launch tests in Terminal.app:
```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script "cd ~/Desktop/FinOPS && npm run test > /tmp/vitest_output.txt 2>&1 && echo __VITEST_DONE__ >> /tmp/vitest_output.txt"'
```

3. Wait for tests to complete (poll for the done marker, max 120s):
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 120); do grep -q __VITEST_DONE__ /tmp/vitest_output.txt 2>/dev/null && break; sleep 1; done
```

4. Read the test results:
```bash
cat /tmp/vitest_output.txt
```

5. Check for failures — look for the summary line. Expected output for a clean run:
```
Test Files  0 failed | NN passed (NN)
     Tests  0 failed | NN passed (NN)
```

If there are failures, investigate the specific test file(s) and fix them.

## Notes

- Tests are in `src/__tests__/` and co-located `*.test.ts` files
- DB-layer tests require `DATABASE_URL` to be set in `.env.local`
- Run `npm run test:watch` for interactive development mode
